# COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage in India Data Analysis 



## Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted India, with over 26 million confirmed cases and more than 295,000 deaths as of May 2023. The Indian government launched a nationwide vaccination drive to mitigate the pandemic's effects. This study analyzes COVID-19 vaccination data to understand trends and identify areas for improvement. Our findings are expected to help healthcare officials and policymakers optimize the vaccination drive.

## Methodology
The data analysis was performed using **Power BI**. The following steps were followed:
1. **Data Import and Transformation:** The `covid_vaccine_statewise.csv` dataset was loaded into Power BI. Data cleaning included handling missing values and adjusting data types.
2. **Measures and Calculations:** Custom measures were created to calculate the number of vaccinated individuals by state and gender. Additional measures were used to compute vaccination coverage rates and visualize the data.
3. **Visualization:** Various visuals, including bar charts, pie charts, and maps, were created to display state-wise vaccination data, gender distribution, and overall coverage.

## Visualizations
- **Bar Charts:** Depict vaccination numbers for each state and gender.
- **Maps:** Geographical representation of vaccination coverage across India.
- **Pie Charts:** Show the proportion of males and females vaccinated.
- **Line Graphs:** Illustrate trends in confirmed COVID-19 cases among Indian and foreign nationals.
- **Funnel Charts:** Display the usage of different vaccines (Covishield, Covaxin, Sputnik V).

## Results and Discussion
The analysis revealed significant state-wise variations in vaccination coverage. Maharashtra had the highest vaccination rate, while smaller regions like Lakshadweep had lower numbers. Gender analysis showed disparities that require further investigation to ensure equitable access to vaccines.

## Conclusion
This study provides evidence-based insights into vaccination trends in India. The results are expected to inform future decisions on resource allocation and public health strategies, ensuring a more effective and equitable vaccination drive.
